# Browser Startpage

## Goal

This project aims to provide an easy way to customize your browser start page with links and wallpapers.

## Setup

Download the project and then define index.html as your browser homepage or new page.

## Customization

### Links

In the index.html folder you can find a script tag that contains two JSON objects.

The **flexLinks** JSON allows you to add links to the first section.

The **gridLinks** JSON allows you to add links to the second section.

### Wallpapers

The Wallpaper is set according to the day of the week. To choose what image is shown each day, add the image name and extension to the **wallpapers** object.

Don't forget to drop the image with the same into the wallpapers folder. The same goes for logos.
